The project involves the use of self-designed image processing algorithms and techniques designed using python to segment the disease from the leaf while using the concepts of machine learning to categorise the plant leaves as healthy or infected. By this method, the plant diseases can be identified at the initial stage itself and the pest and infection control tools can be used to solve pest problems while minimizing risks to people and the environment.
